## Hello, I'm Charles 👋

#### About me

- 💼 I am an AI engineer with 5+ years of experience in data science.

- 🤖 I worked with a large variety of methods such as 3D and 2D computer vision, NLP, bioclinical data clustering, predictive modelling.

- 🌍 I was AI Engineer at the French Mapping Agency (IGN) and built their software and methods to do 3D deep learning: from dataset creation to nation-wide Lidar semantic segmentation.

- ❤️ I like python and building well-thought AI systems: machine learning is not all about the model!
